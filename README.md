* Date: 6/6/2015
* Location: Bitwise Industries

# User Story

* A user could query and drill down into aggregated data about health care facilities in Fresno area easily.
* Utilizing speech recognition of mobile platforms (part of the platforms, not our project)

# Server side

* we integrated 60+ datasets
* The query by a key word will filter that data
* Written in Python
* NLP queries in the future?
* Possible regression of datasets where several year is available

# Client Side

* Pure HTML5/CSS/JavaScript
* Since mobile usage was a primary goal, the whole UI is taken up by Google Maps canvas
* Spanish multi-language support
* The data visualization will be done by multi-level radial context menus, when the user clicks on custom pin
(demoed at the pitch, but currently under development)
* Future: getting data visualization working and fancy
